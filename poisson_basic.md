### Incorporating Squad Rotation into a basic Poisson Regression Model
- Determine the accuracy of a basic football model as described in various articles online including [pinnacle](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/Soccer/how-to-calculate-poisson-distribution/MD62MLXUMKMXZ6A8)
- Incorporate a metric of squad rotation and dtermine if performance was improved.
- Make suggestions on further metrics and how they may be incorporated.

### Refining the Poisson Model
The method used to assess team strength appears to rudimentary. Including player ability could be a good starting point to imporve this metric. Techniques such as percentile rankings and machine learning clustering methods could provide a means of predicting play style and how this may alter the expected goal rate used to develop the probability distribution.
